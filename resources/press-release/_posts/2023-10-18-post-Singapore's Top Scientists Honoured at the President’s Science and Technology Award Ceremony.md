Singapore, 20 October 2023 – The 2023 **President’s Science &amp; Technology Awards (PSTA)** celebrated top talent in Singapore’s material science and space technologies fields earlier this evening. The PSTA is the highest honour conferred upon research scientists and engineers in Singapore whose work has resulted in significant scientific, technological, or economic benefits for the country.

This year, awards from three categories were given out:

* **President’s Science &amp; Technology Medal (PSTM):** Awarded to individuals who have made distinguished, sustained, and exceptional contributions in advancing Singapore’s development through the promotion and management of science and technology (S&amp;T).
* **President’s Science Award (PSA):** Awarded to individuals or teams for outstanding contributions that have transformed one or more Science &amp; Technology fields.
* **Young Scientist Award (YSA)**<sup>**1**</sup>**:** Awarded to individuals 35 years or under with demonstrable potential to be world-class researchers in their fields of expertise. 

The winners received their awards from **President Tharman Shanmugaratnam** at the Istana.

### Singapore’s Tech Luminary: Fostering Innovation and Research Excellence

The **President’s Science and Technology Medal** was awarded to **Mr Quek Gim Pew** for his outstanding contributions in shaping Singapore’s Research, Innovation, and Enterprise (RIE) ecosystem. These include developing local capabilities in science and technology, particularly in space technology, quantum engineering, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing, and championing STEM-related initiatives to nurture the next-generation of scientists and engineers.
 
Over four decades of dedicated service within the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), Mr Quek has been a driving force behind numerous initiatives. For example, he spearheaded defence research and development, fostered the growth of essential strategic capabilities, and fortified partnerships with international organisations. 

As Chief Defence Scientist, he saw the establishment of innovative programmes uniting MINDEF with the local RIE ecosystem. This strategic move intensified the dynamic synergy between these two pivotal communities, propelling Singapore's defence capabilities to new heights.

Transitioning to emerging frontiers, Mr Quek directed his attention towards quantum technologies. During his tenure as Chair of the Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT), he orchestrated a shift from a primarily fundamental science-focused approach to a nationwide initiative on quantum research.

He went on to Co-Chair the National Quantum Steering Committee (NQSC), and drove the Quantum Engineering Programme (QEP) for applications, including securing communication systems and financial services networks. A notable example was his contributions to the National Quantum-safe Network, which aims to deliver quantum-safe communications across Singapore.

A staunch advocate for collaboration, Mr Quek actively fostered partnerships with local and international entities, pooling resources for collective quantum research endeavours. This accelerated the growth of Singapore's quantum capabilities and solidified the nation's reputation as a globally recognised hub for quantum research.

Mr Quek's steadfast commitment to nurturing a robust STEM talent pipeline has been exemplary. During his tenure at the DSO National Laboratories (DSO), he championed initiatives encouraging senior staff to actively engage and mentor students through the Young Defence Scientist Programme. Under his leadership, he also initiated a series of engaging competitions for students, offering valuable learning experiences through hands-on activities and friendly contests.
 
As the Deputy Chairman of Singapore's Office for Space Technology &amp; Industry (OSTIn), Mr Quek provides direction and vision for OSTIn's objectives. With his extensive background in space technologies and capability development, he offers invaluable insights to OSTIn’s Space Technology Development Programme. Furthermore, Mr Quek actively steers outreach and student engagement efforts through the Integrated Space Programme. This programme exposes students to the intricacies of space science, engineering, and orbital missions, giving selected students the rare opportunity to design and construct cubesats<sup>2</sup> slated for launch into space.

Currently, he is the Senior R&amp;D Consultant of MINDEF and sits on various boards of agencies, organisations, and Institutes of Higher Learning.

### Revolutionary Material Science Breakthroughs in Thermal Radiation and Diffusion

**Dr Qiu Cheng-Wei** was awarded the **President’s Science Award** for his contributions to the field of topological thermal diffusion and radiation. His recent breakthrough in material science can enhance thermal conduction better than silver and gold, as well as potentially cool a room down without using any extra power.

By structuring conductive thermal metamaterials into paints and concrete, any surface coated with the special material can channel heat to cooler areas, cooling the overall space in a room. With less energy spent cooling buildings, the discovery would support Singapore’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Using quantum mechanics wave theories, Dr Qiu’s research has paved the way for ground-breaking techniques to ‘lock up’ and dissipate heat. This is a complete departure from prevailing research in thermal diffusion. His research work can be further applied to many technologies that require efficient self-heat removal from overheated chips.

Dr Qiu is currently an Associate Professor and the Dean’s Chair Professor at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) College of Design and Engineering. He has received multiple accolades for his research efforts and had published over 480 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier journals.

## Young Scientists Awards

### Unravelling Unexplored Quantum Potential of Natural Materials

**Dr Chang Guoqing** from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU) was awarded the **Young Scientist Award** for his work in uncovering quantum potential among natural materials. These materials have properties that contemporary physics have yet to fully unearth. 
 
Dr Chang uses advance mathematical and computation methods to predict and discover hidden quantum behaviours in these special materials. His efforts have identified materials that can sense light in unique ways. This could pave the way towards developing better solar panels and refined light-detection systems.

### Pioneering New Cryogenic Electron Microscopy Methods to Improve Drug Development

**Dr Tan Yong Zi** from National University of Singapore (NUS) was awarded the **Young Scientist Award** pioneering new techniques in cryogenic electron microscopy to improve the drug development process. His research helps the medical community understand the tiny protein structures in bacteria or diseased cells, and identify specific parts or sites to target for drug development.

Dr Tan has visualised structures of proteins from many diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, cancer and more recently COVID-19. His research findings illustrated how drug resistance occurs and this resulted in the creation of new therapeutics.

### Developing AI for the Future of Computing

**Dr Soujanya Poria** from SUTD was awarded the **Young Scientist Award** for his work in developing conversational AI models that are equipped with multimodal reasoning abilities.
 
By combining text, audio, and video data from human interactions, Dr Soujanya and his team have developed AI systems that can understand human intentions and emotions. This helps AI make better decisions. This will greatly enhance machine-to-human interactions and assist in human-to-human understanding.
 
Dr Poria and his team's work has led to the development of several multimodal understanding and generative systems including a text-to-audio AI model that can create sounds from text descriptions, like a dog barking or an audience applauding at a concert.
