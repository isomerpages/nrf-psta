<p>The President’s Science and Technology Awards recognise outstanding achievements
in our scientific community – achievements with the potential to tackle
critical challenges and improve the quality of life.
<br>
<br>This year’s awardees once again exemplify innovative excellence. From
advancing cancer research to improve immunotherapy outcomes, to pushing
the frontiers of semiconductor technology for both defence and commercial
applications. And from nurturing future leaders, to fostering interdisciplinary
collaboration, to shaping our R&amp;D landscape.
<br>
<br>Our Young Scientist Award recipients, too, are opening new chapters –
from uncovering how the brain defends itself from life-threatening infections,
to developing machine learning techniques that train AI models using limited
resources. I look forward to seeing them and other young scientists make
even greater impact in the years to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My warmest congratulations to each of this year’s recipients of the President’s
Science and Technology Awards!</p>
<p></p>
