Our largest global challenges, in addressing shifts in the earth’s environment and future pandemic risks, highlight the criticality of science and technology in finding effective solutions. Singapore’s future too will rest both on the advance of these global solutions, and on its own economic and social development being increasingly enabled by technological innovation.  

This year, the President's Science and Technology Awards (PSTA) honour individuals who have made exceptional contributions in the fields of material science, quantum mechanics and space technologies. From creating novel materials that could lead to cooler microelectronics and more energy efficient buildings, to enhancing Singapore’s capacity to design and manufacture satellites, these achievements can meaningfully enhance productivity, economic performance and sustainability.

Our Young Scientist Awardees have also made significant research inroads in natural language processing, quantum materials and membrane proteins associated with human diseases. They point to a bright future for the advancement and use of science and technology in Singapore.

My warmest congratulations to all the award recipients!
