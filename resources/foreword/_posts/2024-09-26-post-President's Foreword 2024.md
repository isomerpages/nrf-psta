<p>The President’s Science and Technology Awards recognises outstanding achievements
in our scientific community, with the potential to tackle the challenges
of our times and touch many lives. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>This year’s awardees once again exemplify the spirit of innovation. From
shaping our R&amp;D landscape, to nurturing talent and fostering interdisciplinary
collaborations. From transforming the management of cardio-respiratory
diseases, to resolving a mystery in organic luminescent materials that
have stumped scientists for decades, enabling the design of high-performance
materials with important new applications.
<br>
<br>Our Young Scientist Award recipients themselves reflect the growing depth
and diversity of Singapore’s R&amp;D talent pipeline. Their contributions
span across advancing artificial intelligence, designing green catalysts
for sustainable manufacturing, developing computational methods for ribonucleic
acid research, and improving eye health. I look forward to seeing them
and other young scientists make even greater impacts in the years to come.
<br>
<br>My warmest congratulations to each of this year’s recipients of the President’s
Science and Technology Awards!</p>
