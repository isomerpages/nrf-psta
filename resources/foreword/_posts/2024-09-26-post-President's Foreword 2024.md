<p>Our largest global challenges, in addressing shifts in the earth’s environment
and future pandemic risks, highlight the criticality of science and technology
in finding effective solutions. Singapore’s future too will rest both on
the advance of these global solutions, and on its own economic and social
development being increasingly enabled by technological innovation.</p>
<p>This year, the President's Science and Technology Awards (PSTA) honour
individuals who have made exceptional contributions in the fields of material
science, quantum mechanics and space technologies. From creating novel
materials that could lead to cooler microelectronics and more energy efficient
buildings, to enhancing Singapore’s capacity to design and manufacture
satellites, these achievements can meaningfully enhance productivity, economic
performance and sustainability.</p>
<p>Our Young Scientist Awardees have also made significant research inroads
in natural language processing, quantum materials and membrane proteins
associated with human diseases. They point to a bright future for the advancement
and use of science and technology in Singapore.</p>
<p>My warmest congratulations to all the award recipients!</p>
