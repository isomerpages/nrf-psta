The <b>President’s Science & Technology Awards (PSTA)</b> were first given out in 2009. Originally established as the National Science and Technology Awards (NSTA) in 1987, they were elevated to Presidential status in 2009. Today, the awards are the highest honours bestowed on outstanding scientists and engineers in Singapore, in recognition of the key roles they play in upholding research excellence and strengthening the growing community of scientific talent in the nation.<br><br>
The PSTA consist of four distinct awards — the President’s Science & Technology Medal, the President’s Science Award, the President’s Technology Award, and the Young Scientist Award. The Young Scientist Award is administered by the Singapore National Academy of Science (SNAS) and supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF). Carefully selected by a panel of key representatives that spans government, industry, academia, and public research institutes, the awards recognise individuals and teams that have made exceptional contributions in pushing the boundaries of the research and innovation landscape in Singapore.
