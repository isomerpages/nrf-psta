The PSTA is the country’s top honours for research scientists and engineers in Singapore. As the highest accolade, the PSTA brand carries prestige, influence, and most importantly, inspires the next generation. PSTA winners create orbits of impact through their exceptional work, personal ingenuity, and continued search for excellence; they are role models for their peers and aspiring young researchers in the science and tech fields.

Our winners inspire the PSTA logotype; the stylised ‘S’ puts winners at the core, recognising the ripple impact they have on a national and global scale. Supported by the surrounding 3 dots — NRF’s dynamic Research, Innovation and Enterprise (R.I.E) ecosystem — breakthroughs are transformed into real-world change for future generations.
