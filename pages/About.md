### **History of the Awards**
The <b>President’s Science & Technology Awards (PSTA)</b> were first given out in 2009. Originally established as the National Science and Technology Awards (NSTA) in 1987, they were elevated to Presidential status in 2009. Today, the awards are the highest honours bestowed on outstanding scientists and engineers in Singapore, in recognition of the key roles they play in upholding research excellence and strengthening the growing community of scientific talent in the nation.<p>
The PSTA consist of four distinct awards — the President’s Science & Technology Medal, the President’s Science Award, the President’s Technology Award, and the Young Scientist Award. Carefully selected by a panel of key representatives that spans government, industry, academia, and public research institutes, the awards recognise individuals and teams that have made exceptional contributions in pushing the boundaries of the research and innovation landscape in Singapore.

### **The PSTA Brand**
The PSTA is the country’s top honours for research scientists and engineers in Singapore. As the highest accolade, the PSTA brand carries prestige, influence, and most importantly, inspires the next generation. PSTA winners create orbits of impact through their exceptional work, personal ingenuity, and continued search for excellence; they are role models for their peers and aspiring young researchers in the science and tech fields.<p><img src="/images/Logos/psta-logo-vfc.png" alt="President’s Science and Technology Awards Logo" style="width:400px"/>
Our winners inspire the PSTA logotype; the stylised ‘S’ puts winners at the core, recognising the ripple impact they have on a national and global scale. Supported by the surrounding 3 dots — NRF’s dynamic Research, Innovation and Enterprise (R.I.E) ecosystem — breakthroughs are transformed into real-world change for future generations.
