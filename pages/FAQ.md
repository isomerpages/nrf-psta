<h3>General</h3>
<h4>1. When does the nomination period start?</h4>
<p>Nominations for the 2024 <strong>President’s Science and Technology Awards (PSTA)</strong> open
from 13 December 2023. Do note that recommendations must be submitted by
29 February 2024.
<br>
<br>Our winners will be announced at the PSTA Awards Ceremony in 2024, so

updates.</p>
<h4>2. What is the difference between the awards?</h4>
<p>The <strong>President’s Science and Technology Medal (PSTM)</strong> recognises
accomplishments that have significantly advanced Singapore’s development
through promoting and managing Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T).</p>
<p>These accomplishments are generally acknowledged by the S&amp;T ecosystem
as having a significant impact on the ecosystem’s capabilities or international
stature. The PSTM is not meant to recognise research accomplishments or
contributions to advancing individual technologies, as these are covered
by the PSA and PTA respectively.</p>
<p>The <strong>President’s Science Award (PSA)</strong> recognises accomplishments
generally acknowledged by other S&amp;T practitioners as being significant
and impactful to their field. They need not have led to practical applications
or products.</p>
<p>The <strong>President’s Technology Award (PTA)</strong> recognises accomplishments
that have led to transformative changes in the use or potential of technology
in Singapore or further afield. The relevant technology need not be fully
adopted or deployed at the point of nomination, but its potential must
be acknowledged, and it must have progressed beyond academic or theoretical
potential and be in the process of translation or adoption by end-users.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<h4>5. Can I nominate myself for an award, and if so, how can I do so?</h4>
<p>You can nominate yourself (or your team) for the PSA and the PTA only.
Please note that the PSTM is not open for self-nomination.</p>
<h4>6. Who can nominate for PSTA?</h4>
<p>Singaporean Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, and Foreigners can
nominate for the PSTA. Foreigners who have a Foreign Identification Number
(FIN) should register for Singpass, before submitting nominations via the
nomination portal. Please refer to <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/home/ui/support" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.singpass.gov.sg/home/ui/support</a> for
instructions.</p>
<h4>7. Is the PSTA open only to nominees who are Singaporeans? What about nominees who are Foreigners and Singapore Permanent Residents?</h4>
<p>The three award categories - the PSTM, PSA, and PTA - are open to all
who have contributed to Singapore’s research, innovation, and enterprise
ecosystem regardless of background or nationality.</p>
<p>Nominees should have substantive research, innovation, and enterprise
contributions anchored primarily in Singapore, and their achievements should
be relevant to the award they are being nominated for.</p>
<h4>8. Do the achievements of the individual or team being nominated need to fall within a specific time frame?</h4>
<p>Achievements need not fall within a specific time frame as long as their
research, innovation, and enterprise contributions are anchored mainly
in Singapore.</p>
<h4>9. Can the same person be nominated for an individual award, as well as a team award under the PTA or PSA in the same year?</h4>
<p>Yes, an individual can be considered for multiple awards if his or her
achievements are distinct. If the individual is being nominated for one
achievement, the nominator should decide which award category is most appropriate.</p>
<h4>10. Is there a limit on the number of nominations submitted by each institution, or for each award?</h4>
<p>There is no limit on the number of nominations submitted by each institution,
and no limit on the number of nominations for each award. Re-submissions
from previous years are also welcome.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Nomination documents</h3>
<h4>11. Can CVs of nominees be attached, together with the nominations?</h4>
<p>CVs are not required for nominations. The relevant information required
by the selection committees should be entered into the award forms which
can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.psta.gov.sg/nominate/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.psta.gov.sg/nominate/</a> and
uploaded via the <a href="https://form.gov.sg/63a292918c013d00129d6d81" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nomination Portal</a>.
Only the award forms will be shared with the selection committees. The
Secretariat will approach the nominator or nominee should the committee
require more information or clarifications.</p>
<h4>12. Are letters of support from institutions required for nominations?</h4>
<p>Letters of support are not required for nominations. Should an institution
wish to endorse a nomination, the nomination can be submitted by/through
the institution (e.g. its research office). The selection committees treat
nominations with or without letters of support from institutions equally.</p>
<h4>13. How many members can be included in a team nomination for PTA and PSA?</h4>
<p>A team nomination for PTA and PSA can include up to 4 members. Each team
member must have distinct and substantial contributions to the accomplishments
for which the team is being nominated for.</p>
<h4>14. Do the independent reviewers for the PSA and PTA need to be local, or can they be based overseas?</h4>
<p>Reviewers can be local or based overseas so long as they meet the independence
criteria of having no working (e.g. participation in the same project or
grant) or reporting relationship with the nominee within the past 5 years.</p>
<h4>15. What if the proposed independent reviewers turn out to be in the selection committees?</h4>
<p>PSTA secretariat will seek alternative reviewers in such cases, and there
will be no impact to the status of the nomination. The nominator does not
need to ensure that their proposed reviewers are not on the selection committees.</p>
<h3>Awards assessment</h3>
<h4>16. Are individual nominations and team nominations assessed differently for the PSA and PTA?</h4>
<p>Individual and team nominations for the PSA and PTA are assessed equally.
There are no different criteria or processes between the assessment of
individual and team nominations.</p>
