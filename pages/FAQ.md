**What is the difference between the awards?**

The PSA recognises accomplishments that have a transformative effect on one or more S&T fields. These achievements are generally acknowledged by other S&T practitioners as being significant and impactful to their field. However, they need not have led to practical applications or products.

The PTA recognises accomplishments that have led to significant changes in the use or potential of technology. These accomplishments would generally be acknowledged by relevant industry players as marking a turning point for that technology’s use or potential, with a significant impact on the industry.

The PSTM recognises accomplishments that have significantly advanced Singapore’s development through promoting and managing S&T. The accomplishments would generally be acknowledged by the S&T ecosystem as having a significant impact on the ecosystem’s capabilities or international stature. The PSTM is not meant to recognise research accomplishments or contributions to advancing individual technologies, as these are covered by the PSA and PTA, respectively.
