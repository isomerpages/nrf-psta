#### When does the nomination period start and end?

The nomination period for the <b>President’s Science & Technology Awards (PSTA)</b> 2023 runs from 25 January 2023 to 31 March 2023.

#### What is the difference between the awards?

The **President’s Science & Technology Medal (PSTM)** recognises accomplishments that have significantly advanced Singapore’s development through promoting and managing S&T. 

These accomplishments are generally acknowledged by the S&T ecosystem as having a significant impact on the ecosystem’s capabilities or international stature. The PSTM is not meant to recognise research accomplishments or contributions to advancing individual technologies, as these are covered by the PSA and PTA respectively.

The **President’s Science Award (PSA)** recognises accomplishments that have had a transformative effect on one or more Science & Technology (S&T) fields. These achievements are generally acknowledged by other S&T practitioners as being significant and impactful to their field. However, they need not have led to practical applications or products.

The **President’s Technology Award (PTA)** recognises accomplishments that have led to transformative changes in the use or potential of technology. These accomplishments are generally acknowledged by other S&T practitioners as resulting from deep innovative input or ingenuity, marking a turning point for that technology's use or potential with a significant impact on the industry.
