#### When does the nomination periond start and end?

The nomination period for the President’s Science and Technology Awards (PSTA) 2023 will be open from 25 Jan 2023 to 31 March 2023.

#### What is the difference between the awards?

The **President’s Science Award (PSA)** recognises accomplishments that have a transformative effect on one or more Science & Technology (S&T) fields. These achievements are generally acknowledged by other S&T practitioners as being significant and impactful to their field. However, they need not have led to practical applications or products.

The **President’s Technology Award (PTA)** recognises accomplishments that have led to transformative changes in the use or potential of technology. The accomplishments would generally be acknowledged by other S&T practitioners, as resulting from deep innovative input or ingenuity, marking a turning point for that technology's use or potential with a significant impact on the industry.

The **President’s Science and Technology Medal (PSTM)** recognises accomplishments that have significantly advanced Singapore’s development through promoting and managing S&T. The accomplishments would generally be acknowledged by the S&T ecosystem as having a significant impact on the ecosystem’s capabilities or international stature. The PSTM is not meant to recognise research accomplishments or contributions to advancing individual technologies, as these are covered by the PSA and PTA, respectively.
